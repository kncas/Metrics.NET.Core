Metrics.NET - a .NET Port, with lots of additional functionality, of the awesome Java [metrics library](https://github.com/dropwizard/metrics) by Coda Hale.

This is a continuation of the original (now unmaintained) project https://github.com/etishor/Metrics.NET.

The project was ported to .NET 6.0 by ReMoose: https://github.com/ReMoose/Metrics.NET.

This fork has added runtime targets for .NET Standard 2.0 and .NET 5.0, 6.0, 7.0 and 8.0, and can be found here: https://github.com/kncas/Metrics.NET.Core.
